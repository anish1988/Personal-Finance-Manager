Perfect 👌 — let’s set this up like a real-world Agile project blueprint that a top-tier product team would follow. I’ll structure this into Requirement Docs, Analysis, Functional/Non-functional Specs, System Design, Module Breakdown, Milestones, Tasks & Subtasks. This way you’ll have everything needed to run the project in Agile (Scrum/Kanban) with clear deliverables and a roadmap that scales into a mobile app later.

📂 Epics, Stories, Tasks Breakdown

Nice 👌 you’ve written a very clear **Epic 1**. Let’s refine it a little so it fully respects **SOLID** (for code design), **12-Factor App** (for infra), and **Agile** (for breakdown).

---

# 📌 Refined Epic 1: Project Setup

**Epic 1: Project Setup**
As a developer, I want a properly structured repo, environment, and baseline infra so that all contributors can start development smoothly, and the project adheres to **SOLID principles** and the **12-Factor App methodology** from the beginning.

---

## ✅ User Stories

### **User Story 1.1**

*As a developer, I want to set up the project repository with a clear structure and guidelines so that contributors can work consistently.*
**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Repo created with `README.md`, `.gitignore`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`
* Branch strategy documented (e.g., `main`, `develop`, feature branches)
* Folder structure reflects **Clean Architecture** + **DDD**

---

### **User Story 1.2**

*As a developer, I want to set up containerized services (backend, frontend, DB) using Docker Compose so that dev/prod parity is ensured.*
**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Docker Compose brings up backend, frontend, and Postgres successfully
* Config managed via `.env` (12-Factor: config externalized)
* Each service logs to stdout/stderr (12-Factor: logs as streams)

---

### **User Story 1.3**

*As a developer, I want to implement database migrations so that schema changes are version-controlled and repeatable.*
**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Alembic integrated with SQLAlchemy
* `alembic.ini` configured
* Example migration generated & applied

---

### **User Story 1.4**

*As a developer, I want to seed standard categories and subcategories so that users have a baseline for expense tracking.*
**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Init SQL or Alembic seed script available
* Categories/Subcategories created: e.g. Food > Groceries, Transport > Fuel, etc.
* Idempotent (safe to re-run)

---

### **User Story 1.5**

*As a developer, I want a CI/CD pipeline so that builds, tests, and deployments run automatically.*
**Acceptance Criteria:**

* GitHub Actions (or Jenkins) workflow defined
* On every push: linting + tests + build containers
* On `main` branch: deploy (staging/prod environment ready for future)

---

## 🛠 Tasks & Subtasks

### **Task 1: Create Repo & Base Structure**

* Subtask 1.1: Create GitHub/GitLab repo
* Subtask 1.2: Add `README.md`, `.gitignore`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`
* Subtask 1.3: Define branch strategy

### **Task 2: Configure Docker Compose**

* Subtask 2.1: Backend `Dockerfile` (FastAPI, requirements.txt)
* Subtask 2.2: Frontend `Dockerfile` (React, package.json)
* Subtask 2.3: Postgres service with `.env` configs
* Subtask 2.4: Run `docker-compose up` and validate

### **Task 3: Setup Database Migrations**

* Subtask 3.1: Install Alembic
* Subtask 3.2: Configure `alembic.ini` for Postgres
* Subtask 3.3: Create initial migration for `transactions` table

### **Task 4: Seed Categories/Subcategories**

* Subtask 4.1: Define category/subcategory model in SQLAlchemy
* Subtask 4.2: Write seed script (via Alembic or custom script)
* Subtask 4.3: Test idempotency (running multiple times doesn’t break DB)

### **Task 5: Configure CI/CD**

* Subtask 5.1: Create GitHub Actions workflow
* Subtask 5.2: Add jobs: lint, test, build containers
* Subtask 5.3: Setup staging deploy step (placeholder for now)

---

## 🔑 Why This Matches Principles

* **SOLID:** Repo is modular (services, migrations, seeding separated).
* **12-Factor App:** Config externalized, backing services attached (Postgres), dev/prod parity enforced (Docker), logs streamed.
* **Agile:** Clear Epic → Stories → Tasks → Subtasks breakdown.
* **Clean Arch/DDD:** Structure enforces separation between domain logic, infra, and delivery from the beginning.
